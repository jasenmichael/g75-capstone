# Project Description
SimpleExpenses - a simple yet robust receipt and expenses application. Tracking, logging, exporting expenses, and doing taxes has never been easier!

## Problem statement
I don't know if you are like me, but I have a shoe box with all my receipts from multiple businesses and categories. I dread doing the tedious task of one by one sorting them and adding to a spreadsheet. I simply want to just add receipts, then be able to sort, view, edit and export the data.
